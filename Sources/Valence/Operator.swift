/// An `Operator` is the principle kind of data carried in an ABT.  They delimit
/// the kinds of operations supported by a particular language or grammar and
/// capture the binding and scope of variables relevant to each operation.
///
/// An Operator can also be thought of as a local map from an operation kind to
/// an *arity* for that operation that generalizes the natural-number arity of
/// ASTs to structures capturing the valence of arguments.
